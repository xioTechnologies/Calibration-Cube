Calibration-Cube-Protractor
===========================

The Calibration Cube Protractor is a gimbal that allows the [Calibration Cube](https://github.com/xioTechnologies/Calibration-Cube) to be precisely rotated around a single axis in 5Â° steps.  The Calibration Cube can be mounted at any orthogonal orientation for rotations around all three axis.  This allows evaluation of accelerometer performance (as pitch and roll) through rotations around a horizontal axis; and magnetometer performance (as yaw) through rotations around the vertical axis.

The protractor is made from 5 mm laser cut acrylic plastic and assembled with glue.  It does not feature any metallic parts as these may interfere with the magnetometer.

The design was created from a single 3D part designed in SolidWorks and selected surfaces then exported as DXF files.  The SolidWorks part itself is not intended to be manufactured.  The DXF files were imported to [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) to add engraved text and layout the parts for the laser cutter.

The parts must be used at the correct orientation to achieve a flush fit given the natural chamfer created by the laser cutter.  The bottom side of the cog is indicated by the engraved "Bottom" label.
